This is built using python library turtle. This library is a part of standard python library which allows users to create shapes and pictures with a provided virtual canvas.
Turtle graphics provides a representation of a physical “turtle” (a little robot with a pen) that draws on a virtual sheet of paper on the floor.
We can run the code as we used to run basic python code.
